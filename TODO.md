This tracker maintains active, upcoming, and future tasks for the **Front Desk PWA**.

## 🐛 Critical Bug Tracker

## 🐛 Critical Bug Tracker

### BUG-01: Limbo Tray Drag Failure & Click-to-Restore Mechanism (RESOLVED in v1.35.0)
- **Status**: 🟢 Resolved (v1.35.0)
- **Solution Delivered**:
  - [x] Made displaced Limbo cards draggable in all views (`div.draggable = true`).
  - [x] Implemented `handleDisplacedCardClick`: checks if `(item.ogTeacher, item.period)` is free and restores it cleanly with complete undo/redo integration (`restore_displaced`).
  - [x] Added phone-style side-by-side error jitter animation (`@keyframes errorJitter`) with emergency red glow and native haptic vibration (`navigator.vibrate([45, 55, 45])`) whenever restore or drag is blocked.

### BUG-02: Schedule Re-rendering & Stutter During Scrolling (RESOLVED in v1.35.0)
- **Status**: 🟢 Resolved (v1.35.0)
- **Solution Delivered**:
  - [x] Decoupled table layout recalculations: added width-change guard and debouncing to `window.resize` observer so mobile vertical scrolling (URL bar collapse) never causes layout thrashing.
  - [x] Promoted `.table-scroll-container` and sticky table cells to independent GPU composite layers using `transform: translateZ(0)` and `contain: paint layout`.
  - [x] Moved `backdrop-filter` from the scrolling container to `.master-routine-container`, eliminating continuous per-frame blur re-filtering during scroll.

## 🚀 Active / Next Priorities

### 1. Cloud Sync Status Indicator (`☁ Live` vs `☁ Offline`)
- [ ] **Live Indicator**: Add a prominent yet elegant status badge/icon in the header/settings indicating the cloud Google Sheet is connected and syncing seamlessly (e.g., `🟢 Cloud Live` or `☁ Live` with a soft green pulse).
- [ ] **Offline Indicator**: When disconnected, no internet, or endpoint unreachable, clearly display `⚪ Sheet Offline` or `⚠ Offline Mode` with last sync timestamp.
- [ ] **Interactive Sync Details**: Tapping the status pill reveals connectivity diagnostics (endpoint URL, ping status, last successful fetch, manual re-sync button).

### 2. Teacher Roster Mobile Long-Press & Honorific Display
- [ ] **Mobile Long-Press for Sub-Availability**:
  - Phones cannot easily right-click. Add a 500ms touch-hold listener on teacher avatars (`.teacher-avatar`) with haptic buzz feedback to open the Substitution Availability modal (`#sub-avail-modal`) on mobile.
  - Suppress standard click (absence toggle) when long-press triggers.
  - Retain desktop right-click (`contextmenu`).
- [ ] **Full Honorific Display**:
  - Stop stripping honorific prefixes in `renderAbsentTray()`. Display names with their full respectful titles (e.g., `Mrs. S. Lakra`, `Ms. N. Horo`, `Mr. S. A. Lakra`) across roster cards and timetable views.

### 3. Undo/Redo History Reset Policy & Buffer Pruning
- [ ] **Manual History Purge**: Add a "Clear Action History" button in Settings / Header context menu to wipe undo/redo stacks on demand.
- [ ] **Auto-Reset Policy Options**:
  - Option to clear history buffer when switching days (preventing accidental cross-day undos).
  - Option to wipe history buffer when "Reset to Baseline" is executed.
- [ ] **Buffer Depth Limit**: Enforce a FIFO cap (e.g. maximum 30 actions) to prevent `localStorage` bloating over time.

## 💡 Front-Desk High-Utility Feature Suggestions (Curated for Daily School Operations)

### Suggestion 1: One-Tap WhatsApp & Clipboard Substitution Dispatcher
- **Rationale**: Every morning, front desk staff have to manually notify 4–8 teachers of their substitution assignments.
- **Feature**: A clean "Share Routine" button generating an auto-formatted message:
  ```
  📋 *LFPS Substitution Notice — Monday, Oct 14*
  • Period 2: Mrs. R. Pahwa covering Prep A (English) for Mrs. S. Lakra
  • Period 4: Ms. N. Horo covering KG B (Math) for Mrs. M. Midha
  Please check in at Front Desk.
  ```
  Includes a 1-tap "Share via WhatsApp" (`whatsapp://send?text=...`) and "Copy Slip".

### Suggestion 2: Teacher Substitution Workload & Fair Share Meter
- **Rationale**: In real school administration, assigning the same free teacher multiple times in a week creates resentment and burnout.
- **Feature**: Display a subtle weekly load counter next to candidate names in the substitute picker (e.g. `Mrs. Pahwa (Covered: 1 this week)` vs `Ms. Horo (Covered: 4 this week)`).
- **Benefit**: Ensures equitable distribution across the staff directory.

### Suggestion 3: Morning Quick-Absence Check-In Modal
- **Rationale**: Tapping through the horizontal roster tray can be slow when 5 teachers call in sick before 8:00 AM.
- **Feature**: A rapid multi-select checklist or quick-search popover where the front desk coordinator can check off absent teachers in 10 seconds before assembly.

### Suggestion 4: Notice Board & Principal Print Layout (`@media print`)
- **Rationale**: Many schools require a printed paper slip for the staff room bulletin board and the Principal's signature desk.
- **Feature**: Clean print stylesheet formatting a compact, professional 1-page Substitution Sheet with date, absent teachers, assigned substitutes, room numbers, and signature lines.

### Suggestion 5: Emergency Uncovered Period Alert Chime / Flash
- **Rationale**: If Period 1 starts at 8:15 AM and an absent teacher's class has no substitute assigned by 8:10 AM, students are left unattended.
- **Feature**: An urgent visual pulse or audio chime (`🚨 Period 1 Starting in 5m Uncovered!`) alerting the coordinator immediately.

## 🔮 Future Roadmap Items

### 3. Simple Mode (Basic Manual Logic)
- [ ] Add a user-selectable **Simple Mode** toggle in Settings / Header.
- [ ] Strips away cognitive overload: hides algorithmic solver bells, complex multi-candidate split proposals, and deep administrative panels.
- [ ] Presents strictly the intuitive manual substitution logic:
  1. View absent teacher
  2. Tap/drag period cell
  3. Pick substitute from simple available list
  4. Save / confirm.

### 4. [CRITICAL CODE REVIEW] Technical Debt & Codebase Bloat Elimination
*Identified during the v1.34.0 architectural review. Flagged for a thorough future cleanup session:*
- [ ] **Remove Dead Static Arrays (250+ Lines)**:
  - `masterTimetableLog` (`app.js` lines 289–490, 200 lines): Hardcoded normalized log array that is completely unused by the active application (only exported to `window.masterTimetableLog`).
  - `subjectsCatalog` (`app.js` lines 136–186, 50 lines): Static array exported to window, never utilized by the active routine or solver engines.
- [ ] **Unified Migration Logic**:
  - `migratePeriodNames()` is run on `schedule` and `baseSchedule`, but lines in `loadStateFromStorage()` duplicate the exact same period check on `substitutions` and `displaced`. Consolidate into a single polymorphic sanitizer function.
- [ ] **Dual-Stack History Streamlining**:
  - `state.actionHistory.grid` and `state.actionHistory.subs` currently duplicate every single substitution action into both stacks. Streamline into a single tagged action log with scoped filtering to eliminate memory duplication.
- [ ] **CSS Theme Rule Consolidation**:
  - Scattered theme overrides (e.g. `[data-theme="dark"]`, `[data-theme="midnight"]` rules repeating at lines 1090, 1180, 1598, 1836, 3383 in `styles.css`) should be consolidated into unified theme-specific component stylesheets.
